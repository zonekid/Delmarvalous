GA {common_name:"Reticulated flatwoods salamander ", scientific_name:"Ambystoma bishopi", status:"Endangered ", threat:"The principal threat is habitat destruction as a result of agriculture, silviculture, and residential and commercial development.", img_url:"http://www.caudata.org/cc/images/species/Ambystoma/A_bishopi1BARTLETT.jpg", category:"amphibians"},
GA {common_name:"Frosted Flatwoods salamander", scientific_name:"Ambystoma cingulatum", status:"Endangered", threat:"Potential threats include conversion of pine flatwoods habitat for agriculture, silviculture, or commercial/residential development; drainage or enlargement (with subsequent introduction of predatory fishes) of breeding ponds; habitat alteration resulting from suppression of fire; mortality and collecting losses associated with crayfish harvest; and highway mortality during migration.", img_url:"http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/1111_1111/1111/4649.jpeg", category:"amphibians"},
VA {common_name:"Shenandoah salamander", scientific_name:"Plethodon shenandoah", status:"Endangered ", threat:"Infestation by non-native insects/disease; restricted range of habitat", img_url:"http://www.virginiaherpetologicalsociety.com/amphibians/salamanders/shenandoah-salamander/Shenandoah%20Salamander%20(Plethodon%20shenandoah)0002.JPG", category:"amphibians"},
FL {common_name:"Sand skink", scientific_name:"Neoseps reynoldsi", status:"Threatened", threat:"This species is threatened by habitat destruction for commercial and residential development, agricultural (citrus) development, and phosphate mining. Conversion of habitat to citrus production is the primary threat. Habitat degradation due to fire exclusion is another threat.", img_url:"https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/species_images/doc5037.jpg", category:"amphibians"},
MS {common_name:"Dusky Gopher Frog", scientific_name:"Rana sevosa", status:"Endangered", threat:"Major threats include population isolation (inbreeding and susceptibility to catastrophic events), urbanization, two diseases, and apparent lack of a nearby suitable habitat. The range has been significantly reduced as a result of habitat destruction, fragmentation, and modification.", img_url:"https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/species_images/doc1756.jpg", category:"amphibians"},
