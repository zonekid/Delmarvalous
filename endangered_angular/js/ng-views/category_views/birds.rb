DE {common_name:"Red Knot", scientific_name:"Calidris canutus rufa", status:"Threatened", threat:"The species is vulnerable to extensive land reclamation projects that encroach upon important habitat across its range. Loss of intertidal stopover habitats due to reclamation activities in the Yellow Sea region of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is thought to be driving declines in shorebird populations. These losses are attributed to urban, industrial and agricultural expansion within the region.",  img_url:"https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/species_images/doc3682.jpg", category:"birds"},
