MD {common_name:"Northeastern beach tiger beetle", scientific_name:"Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis", status:"Threatened", threat:"All populations experience dramatic fluctuations in abundance resulting from natural and human related disturbances. In Maryland, a major threat is increased vegetation growth on the cliffs which results in reduction of the bare areas needed for adult ovipositon and larval development. A related threat at privately owned sites is construction of shoreline erosion control structures that results in cliff stabilization and vegetation growth.  Rising water levels in the Chesapeake and apparent increasing impacts from storms result in cliff erosion and breakdown.", img_url:"https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/species_images/doc4860.jpg", category:"insects"},
