north {common_name:"Gray Wolf", scientific_name:"Canis lupus", status:"Endangered", threat:"Their original worldwide range has been reduced by about one-third, primarily in developed areas of Europe, Asia, Mexico, and the United States by poisoning and deliberate persecution due to depredation on livestock. Since about 1970, legal protection, land-use changes, and rural human population shifts to cities have arrested wolf population declines and fostered natural recolonization in parts of Western Europe and the United States, and reintroduction in the western United States. Continued threats include competition with humans for livestock, especially in developing countries, exaggerated concern by the public concerning the threat and danger of wolves, and fragmentation of habitat, with resulting areas becoming too small for populations with long-term viability.", img_url:"https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/species_images/doc3630.jpg", category:"mammals"},
CO {common_name:"Canada Lynx", scientific_name:"Lynx canadensis", status:"Threatened", threat:"In most of Canada and Alaska, trapping of lynx for the fur trade is managed through regulated seasons. Trapping can reduce lynx populations and can have the greatest impact when hare populations cyclically crash. In the 1980s, in response to concerns about over-harvest during the cyclic low of the lynx-hare cycle, Alaska and most Canadian provinces modifying seasons or bag limits to match harvest with lynx population levels and trends.", img_url:"https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/species_images/doc4979.jpg", category:"mammals"},
